# Changelog

## 1.21.0

### Twelve backend presets and OmniRoute control

- Settings offers a backend preset grid: FreeLLMAPI, OmniRoute, Hugging Face,
  Groq, Cerebras, Gemini, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Mistral, Cloudflare Workers AI,
  Together and Novita — picking one fills the URL, model and key hint, and
  links to that platform's key page.
- OmniRoute joins FreeLLMAPI as a managed backend: the Integrations view can
  start/stop it (`npm i -g omniroute`, gateway on `localhost:20128`), app-owned
  processes are shut down at exit, and its status card shows whether the app
  or the user started it.

### Deep search

- The composer gains a **Deep** toggle: research mode runs up to 3 planned web
  queries (Exa or Tavily keys in Settings → Deep search) and answers with
  cited `[1]` sources listed under the reply. Every step — planning, each
  query, each source — streams in as a live checklist next to the answer.
- Direct Gemini and OpenAI backends use their built-in web tools
  (`google_search` grounding, Responses `web_search`) with no search key.
- Hard-bounded: 3 queries, 6 results each, 12 sources, capped evidence.

### Freebuff-style shell

- Settings is grouped into Connection / Chat context / Deep search sections.
- User messages render as filled bubbles; thread rows show relative
  timestamps; the top bar carries a New-thread button.

### Fixes

- The VS Code extension build recurses into the shared UI tree so bundled
  skills land in the VSIX.

## 1.20.5

### Always-on skills from `~/.agents/skills`

- A third discovery root reads every `SKILL.md` pack under `~/.agents/skills`
  alongside the project folder and the user config dir.
- YAML descriptions written as folded blocks (`description: >` or `|`) now
  parse to their real text instead of a stray `" > "`, so auto-suggest matches
  on the whole summary.

### Composer skill picker and auto-suggest

- The composer gains a "Skill" picker, an attached-skill chip and a keyword
  auto-suggest: the first enabled skill whose id/name/description contains a
  five-letter-plus word of the draft message is offered and can be cleared
  before sending. The request body now passes `skill` through to the router.

### Five new views

- **Workspaces** — the server-backed project list with switch/rename/archive/
  delete and the open-folder controls collected on one page.
- **Agents** — every enabled skill as a runnable agent; Attach flips the same
  `activeSkillId` state the composer chip reads.
- **Integrations** — live cards for the router, the workspace and a chat
  round-trip, each with its own Test button.
- **Artifacts** — a depth- and count-bounded flat file listing of the open
  folder, grouped by extension (`/api/workspace/files`).
- **Automation** — saved prompt recipes with an optional skill, persisted in
  `~/.config/free-ai-studio/workflows.json`; running one loads the prompt and
  skill into a fresh chat round.

### Honest router pill

- On launch the status pill asks the server for the router's real state
  (`GET /api/router`) instead of forever showing "not tested".

Release **1.19.0** is the current version in `Cargo.toml` and `tauri.conf.json`
(and Android `versionName 1.19.0`, code `16`). It ships the window shell, the
token-budgeted context packer, the router lifecycle, the router console, the
Windows build and the VS Code extension.

Seven commits sit on top of the release (v1.19.1–v1.19.7); each message starts
with its tag and lists exactly what it delivers. v1.19.1–v1.19.6 are already on
`origin/main` — a push recorded under this checkout's git identity at
2026-10-24 11:21, after those six commits were made. **v1.19.7 is local and has
not been pushed.**

## 1.19.0 — the release itself

### Window shell instead of a browser tab

- Tauri 2 loads the local UI in the system webview (WebKitGTK on Linux,
  WebView2 on Windows), so there is no bundled Chromium. `--browser` keeps the
  browser flow and `--no-gui` runs headless for CI and the extension.
- Closing the window runs the same shutdown path as Ctrl+C: the local server
  stops, then the router is brought down if this run started it.
- `app/icons/` carries the sparkle artwork as PNG and ICO for the window and
  the Windows exe.

### Token-budgeted context (the "fewer tokens like Freebuff" part)

- `app/src/context.rs`: 6k default budget (1k–32k ceiling), a newest-N message
  window (2–24), per-message caps, head/tail cropping that keeps both ends, and
  one-line markers so attachments from earlier turns are not re-sent.
- A names-only outline of the open folder goes into the system prompt, never
  file contents.
- Settings expose budget, message window and the outline toggle; the composer
  shows a live `~used / budget` meter and the router's real `context_tokens`
  after each reply.

### Router lifecycle — stop only what the app started

- Studio starts FreeLLMAPI only when its port is not answering, records who
  started it in `router-owned.json`, and runs `docker compose down` on exit
  only when it was the one that started it.
- `free-ai-studio router status|start|stop` exposes the same logic, and the
  console has Start/Stop/Refresh.

### Router console — FreeLLMAPI dashboard features inside the app

- `app/src/router_console.rs` bridges the dashboard API over loopback with a
  desktop session (falling back to a one-time email/password sign-in), forwards
  only allow-listed admin families, and re-mints a stale session exactly once.
- Console tabs: providers (add, enable, delete keys), model catalog with "use
  this model", routing strategy with raw settings, analytics summary and
  by-model table, live logs with clear, and the free-tier budget table.
- `scripts/mock-router.py` is a dependency-free stand-in for the router so the
  console is testable without Docker.

### Windows + releases

- Portable `free-ai-studio.exe` build on `windows-latest`, Windows/macOS folder
  pickers, and cargo linker flags scoped to Linux so one config works both
  places.
- `Desktop Release` builds and attaches all four platforms to one GitHub
  release: Linux tarball/`.deb`/AppImage, the Windows zip, the unsigned Android
  APK/AAB, and the VS Code `.vsix`.

### VS Code extension

- Probes the desktop app; embeds it when it is running and embeddable,
  otherwise starts a built-in server inside the extension that serves the same
  UI and API on a free loopback port, scoped to the open workspace.
- 13 tests cover the packer, store, workspace rules, console path guard, probe
  and both server surfaces. The `.vsix` is about 56 KB.

## Follow-up commits

### v1.19.1 — add window icon assets so the Tauri shell can build

`tauri::generate_context!` panicked with "failed to open icon
`app/icons/icon.png`" because `bundle.icon` named nothing. Adds a 512px PNG and
a 256px PNG-compressed ICO of the four-point sparkle and lists both in
`tauri.conf.json`.

### v1.19.2 — never take ownership of a router this app did not start

`router start` claimed ownership even when the router was already answering, so
app exit could have stopped a router the user launched. `manual_start` now
leaves the flag alone when the port is already up, matching `ensure_started`;
the compose-task error mapping in `shutdown_cleanup` is fixed too. Verified
start/stop/exit against a stub `docker`.

### v1.19.3 — silence the router-console clippy gate

Replaces `assert_eq!(… .is_err(), true)` with `assert!(… .is_err())`, the one
`-D warnings` failure in the desktop CI gate.

### v1.19.4 — rustfmt the crate and remove two dead code paths

`cargo fmt --all` across the touched files, plus removal of the never-read
`Boot.gui_mode` field and the unused `context::outline_from_entries` helper
(the chat path uses `workspace::outline()`), so `cargo clippy --locked
--all-targets -- -D warnings` passes.

### v1.19.5 — keep the composer token meter in step with its inputs

The meter resets to a cheap estimate while a draft is being written and
refreshes on every path that attaches or clears a file, so it never shows the
previous reply's count while you are typing.

### v1.19.6 — this changelog

Documents the release and the follow-up commits above.

### v1.19.7 — align every release artifact on 1.19.0

- `README.md` and `android/README.md` still advertised `1.12.0` (version code
  `15`); both now say `1.19.0` (code `16`), matching `build.gradle.kts` and
  `tauri.conf.json`.
- The extension's `package.json` and its embedded-server `/api/health` payload
  both reported `1.0.0`; both are `1.19.0` now, so the `.vsix`, the desktop
  binary and the APK report one suite version.
- The `Desktop Release` header comment now mentions the Android job it was
  already running, and `/dist/` is git-ignored so a local `vsce package` does
  not dirty the tree.
- The release APK/AAB were rebuilt at `1.19.0` (code `16`) — confirmed with
  `aapt dump badging` — and `vsce package` produced the 56 KB `.vsix`.

## Verification

- `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo test --locked` (57/57), `cargo clippy
  --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings` — all clean.
- Browser pass against the mock router: console tabs, key add/enable/delete,
  model select, strategy save, analytics, logs, budget, message actions row,
  token meter, settings persistence.
- Router lifecycle: compose up on boot, `docker compose down` on SIGINT, and a
  router started by the user stays running after exit.
- Extension: `npm test` (13/13), `tsc --noEmit`, `vsce package` → `dist/
  free-ai-studio-vscode.vsix` (56 KB).
- Android: `gradle assembleRelease bundleRelease` succeeds; `aapt dump
  badging` on the release APK reports `versionCode='16' versionName='1.19.0'`.
